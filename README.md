# k-nearest-neighbors
A Simple k-nearest neighbors implementation in C++

This simple program loads iris.data, normalizes it. Then 1/2 test/training split is done after shuffling data. The final success percentage is written to the console.

Some C++11 featuers are used. Therefore the following command should be used for compilation:

``` 
 g++ -std=c++11  *.cpp
 ```
